## Football Meetup Application :soccer:

A Football Meet-Up Application. Admin can host events and publish it. Events can be added, updated and deleted. Then, a user of the application can RSVP to those created events. That RSVP can be updated or deleted too.

Followed MVC Design Pattern to structure the web application & EJS Template Engine with the use of Partials. Maintained the session of web application and validation using Express. Cross-browser compatible with Chrome and Firefox.

Scaled the application using NoSQL(Mongo) database to persist data with the help of Mongoose ODM. Used asyncawait and Promises to maintain the order of the flow.
